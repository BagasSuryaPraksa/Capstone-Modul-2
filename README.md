## Introduction
In the highly competitive retail industry, large supermarkets face increasingly complex challenges in maintaining and enhancing their marketing and sales performance. Rapidly changing market dynamics, diverse customer preferences, and pressure from competitors make it crucial for supermarkets to continuously innovate their marketing strategies.

## Stakeholder Statement
Management recognizes that a one-size-fits-all approach is no longer sufficient to attract the diverse range of customers. This supermarket offers a variety of premium products and has executed numerous marketing campaigns. However, the results have not been optimal. In an effort to remain relevant and competitive, they feel the need to better understand customer preferences and purchasing behaviors. This includes in-depth analysis of the preferences of different customer generations and their social classes.

Different customer generations have unique behaviors and preferences. For instance, Gen X, Boomers, and Millennials respond differently to the same marketing campaigns. Additionally, social classes such as the Middle Class, Lower Middle Class, and Lower Class exhibit distinct purchasing patterns. Therefore, marketing strategies must be tailored to the characteristics of each customer segment.

While premium products such as wine and meat have performed well, other products have been less popular and need to be boosted in sales. Identifying products with the potential to become market leaders and developing appropriate promotional strategies is crucial to increasing overall sales. Better understanding the correlation between various products can also help design effective cross-promotions.

## Business Problem Statements
In a large supermarket aiming to improve its marketing and sales performance, management sees untapped potential in their marketing campaigns and flagship products. They recognize that to remain competitive in an increasingly challenging industry, they need to better understand their customers' preferences and purchasing behaviors and update their marketing strategies to be more effective.

They realize that a single marketing strategy will not suit all their customers, given the differences in generations and social classes. Therefore, they want to identify the most effective campaign types for attracting the interest of various customer generations and social classes. Additionally, they aim to understand the steps that can be taken to increase sales of less popular products and identify new products with the potential to become market leaders.

## Thus, the problem statements are:

What types of campaigns are most effective in attracting the interest of various customer generations?
What types of campaigns are most effective in attracting the interest of various customer social classes?
What steps can be taken to increase sales of less popular products in the supermarket, and what promotional methods can boost less popular products?
In summary, the role of data analysts extends across these critical areas, demanding careful examination, analytical intelligence, and innovative thinking to drive Walmart's strategic evolution and strengthen its competitive edge in the dynamic retail landscape.

## Project Goals
Identifying Effective Marketing Strategies:
By understanding the types of campaigns that are most effective in attracting the interest of various customer generations, the supermarket can design marketing strategies that better align with the preferences and purchasing behaviors of each generation. This will help increase customer responsiveness to marketing campaigns and maximize promotional effectiveness.

Understanding Customer Preferences by Social Class:
By understanding the types of campaigns that are most effective in attracting the interest of various customer social classes, the supermarket can accommodate the needs and preferences of customers from different social strata. This will aid in crafting more targeted and relevant marketing strategies, thereby enhancing the success of promotional campaigns.

Increasing Sales of Less Popular Products:
By identifying the steps that can be taken to boost sales of less popular products, the supermarket can pinpoint areas that require special attention in their marketing strategy. Additionally, by knowing the effective promotional methods for less popular products, the supermarket can enhance the appeal and visibility of these products to potential customers, thereby increasing overall sales.
